Hello Everyone!

This weeks marks the very beginning of our 2018 summer session!

We are very fortunate to have two of our lovely student student coordinators,
Alex Schwarztberg and Adrian Collado, on staff this summer as instructors, in
addition to our fearless director, Dr. Wes Turner.

Our group this summer is small, weighing in at roughly 12 students, but this is
not a bad thing by any means. While the growth we have experienced has been
amazing, and we are very fortunate to have been able to get to this point, there
are many advantages to operating on a smaller scale. From an administrative
standpoint, the overhead of organizing a club of 150 members often makes it
more difficult to focus on the student experience on a more granular level.

Running a smaller session like we are now allows us to focus on a more
individualized student experience from the very top level, and to get back in
touch with the perspective that is easy to lose at the top of a large
organization.

In other words, having a small group allows us to focus on what RCOS really is,
above all else: a community of people with a shared passion for reaching beyond
their abilities to build awesome stuff.

And there is absolutely no shortage of awesome people this summer. We have an
amazing group of students, who are all very eager to be a part of our community,
and pursue their passions. We are very excited to see what they build, and to
work with each one of them to make their vision a reality.

So stay tuned for more updates!

Until next time,

Ada <3
